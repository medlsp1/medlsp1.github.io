  			<h1>What is the overall quality of your code like?</h1>
  			<h4>4/5</h4>
  			<p>The code that I wrote from scratch (magnifier, toolbar rearranging) followed a logical flow and was generally quality code. Problems arose when modifying existing code (state manager, settings gui) as these were a lot more ridgid and hard to change without just sticking code in where it fits.<p>
  			<p>Overall I'd say I personally wrote quality code, but as always there's room for improvement.<p>
  		</section>
  		<section>
  			<h1>How well did you follow best practices in development?</h1>
  			<h4>3/5</h4>
  			<p>We generally lacked any testing beyond user testing, it is a lot harder to write unit tests for such an interactive application, but some may have helped us</p>
  			<p>We had weekly meetings to make sure we were all on the right track, this insured we had minimal communication issues</p>
  			<p>I wish I did more refactoring early on. Refacting the main state-manager of the application could have made a lot of things go faster<p>
  		</section>
  		<section>
  			<h1>How well did you use appropriate version control?</h1>
  			<h4>4/5</h4>
  			<p>We used version control a lot throughout the whole project, we started off a bit slow, but once we got the hang of it, we were regually merging.</p>
  			<p>Personally, I was always commiting my work to make sure the repo had my latest changes.</p>
  		</section>
  		 <section>
  			<h1>To what extent do you think you contributed an equal portion of the overall project?</h1>
  			<h4>5/5</h4>
  			<p>I think I contributed the most to the project, this is fine as I had the most experience working with the codebase and it's what we agreed on.</p>
  			<p>I was the only person able to make a lot of the changes we wanted (within a decent timeframe) and I always completed my tasks.</p>

		<h2>Professional proficiency</h2>
		<section>
			<h1>How often do you attend scheduled group meetings/scrums?</h1>
			<h4>5/5</h4>
			<p>I don't believe I ever missed a scheduled meeting</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>How well did you communicate with others in your group or subgroup?</h1>
			<h4>4/5</h4>
			<p>I always talked up if I had a question or issue during the meetings.<p>
			<p>During the week, I'd often send a Slack message if I needed to talk to someone else in the group</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1>How well did you document your work throughout the project?</h1>
			<h4>3/5</h4>
			<p>I'd always mark my tasks of on Trello when I had completed one. I'd always write appropriate git commit messages.</p>
			<p>I'd try to write code commennts if working on brand new code, but would often not comment if I was simply modifying existing code.</p>
		</section>
		 <section>
			<h1>How well did you respond to problems or changing requirements?</h1>
			<h4>5/5</h4>
			<p>If there was a new feature that needed to be added, I always was able to get it added in a quick timeframe.</p>
